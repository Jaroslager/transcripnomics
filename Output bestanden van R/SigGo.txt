GOID: GO:0002460
Term: adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune
    receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains
Ontology: BP
Definition: An immune response mediated by lymphocytes expressing specific
    receptors for antigen produced through a somatic diversification process
    that includes somatic recombination of germline gene segments encoding
    immunoglobulin superfamily domains. Recombined receptors for antigen
    encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and
    immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with
    antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great
    magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo
    clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become
    memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory
    cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and
    stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same
    antigen (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune
    response found in Mus musculus.

GOID: GO:0006540
Term: gamma-aminobutyrate shunt
Ontology: BP
Definition: The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of
    succinate from glutamate. Also known as GABA (gamma-aminobutyrate) shunt
    since it channels glutamate into the TCA cycle bypassing two steps of that
    cycle. There are three enzymes involved in the GABA shunt: glutamate
    decarboxylase (GAD), GABA aminotransferase (GABA-TA), and succinate
    semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). These three enzymes acting in concert
    to convert glutamate into succinate. The GABA shunt is predominantly
    associated with neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. It is also
    present in nonneuronal cells, in plants, in unicellular eukaryotes, and in
    prokaryotes.
